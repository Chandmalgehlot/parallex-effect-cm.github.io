          Start this posture lying on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor. You want to align your knees so they are directly over your ankles or heels for good leverage. When you exhale, press your feet firmly into the floor to lift your hips off the ground. Bend your arms at 90 degrees to press the backs of your arms down into the floor to further lift your upper body.
